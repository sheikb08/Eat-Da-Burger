## Description

I created create burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) using the MVC design pattern. I used Node and MySQL to query and route data in this app and used Handlebars to generate the HTML.


## Business Context

This is a fun App that allows its users to keep track of the types of burges that they choose to consume!

## Tech/Modules Used :

### [MySQL](mysql.com):
* MySQL Database Service is a fully managed database service to deploy cloud-native applications using the worldâ€™s most popular open source database. It is 100% developed, managed and supported by the MySQL Team.

### [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expres)
* Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications.


### [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) : 
* Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

### [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) : 
* JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive.
* JavaScript(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
* With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

### [ORM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) : 
* Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.


## Local Installation 
* From workstation: You must perform a "npm install" in the directory hosting the package file.
* Add both the schema.sql and seed.sql data into 'SQL WorkBench' and store it
